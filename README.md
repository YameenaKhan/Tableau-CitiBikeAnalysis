## Analysis Report

### Phenomenon 1: Affect of Covid and Lockdown on Usage of CitiBikes
ANALYSIS

We examined the trend in the number of users of Citibike during the months when there was a COVID breakdown in New York and lockdown was imposed.

The bargraph shows how number of rides fell during the months when lockdown was imposed in February and continued to drop till April. As situation started getting better and moved to the Spring and Summer Months people started using Citibikes more in May and June.

To examine which type of riders were using Citibikes during the lockdown period we can use Pie Chart and Line Graph and the month drop down menu on the dashboard.
-  Februrary: Looking at the pie chart we can see mostly subscribers were the ones users of Citibike and using the line chart we can see people in there mid 30s and 40s (born between 1970 and 1990) were the ones using Citibikes.
-  March & April: The trend of riders is pretty similar for both these months it seems that the customer base is increasing and predominently the riders were from 30-40 age groups.

CONCLUSION

During the lockdown period (Feb 2020 to Apr 2020) the users of Citibike fell significantly, during that period riders were predominantly the people who had subscribed to CitiBikes. Mostly people in their mid 20s to 40s used Citibikes. Older people avoided using Citibikes during the lockdown period.

### Phenomenon 2: Users of which Gender and Age group use CitiBike the most and what are the most popular hours of the Day

ANALYSIS

1. From the Bar Graph on the Left we can see the most number of rides are taken by Men/Male, where as the Average Trip duration for Male is lower than Females and Users who havent specified their Gender.
2. The Area Graph in the Middle of the Dashboard shows the number of Rides and average trip duration per age group. Genders can be filtered from the drop down menu to see which what age group men or women used Citi Bikes most.
What we inferred from here is that for both Genders Male and female we can see that the Age Groups 25 to 40 use Citibikes the most this may be due to the fact that the people of this age group usually live and  work in the city and use Citibikes for their comute.
However the average trip duration increases per for younger ages, which can suggest that younger riders tend to ride longer distances than older ones.
3. Finally the line graph below shows Number of Rides taken by people of each age groups per hour of the day, indicating the hours that are most popular for riding Citi Bikes. Using the Gender and Rider's Birth Year drop down we can adjust and see desired results. We can see the most common age group of Riders is 25 to 40 and Most active time are evening time from 4pm to 8pm

CONCLUSION

In the post lock down months (May 2020 and June 2020) the most active users of Citibikes were Male and Female of ages between 25 to 40 and the hours during which rides were mostly taken were 4pm to 8pm

### Map

ANALYSIS & CONCLUSION

On the Map the Green Dots are the markers for the starting of ride stations and pink dots are markers of ride ending stations from the data set size of the markers is propotional to the popularity of the station. 

We can observe that mostly larger green dots (most popular start stations) are located within the New York City and ride end stations are smaller and more spread out within the state. 

It can be inferred that mostly users tend to take rides from within the city and end their rides to on various stations. It can be concluded that this occurs mainly as people use Citi bikes to commute from their work to home, they take the bike from a station within the city and end their ride on a station near their residence. 

Also a zipcode marker layer has been added on the map as per assignment requirement.
